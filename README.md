# dilans-travel-guide
A capstone project of the Junior Data Scientist course (Data36.com)

The project is based on a fictional business - Dilan's Travel Guide - a travel blog where the owner (Dilan) sells info products - an e-book (selling price $8) and a video course (selling price $80).

The readers of the blog come from three sources: Reddit, SEO, and AdWords.

The main categories of the blog are the continents - Dilan describes his travel experiences on each one.

The business strategy is as follows: new readers visit the blog, they read articles, they subscribe to the newsletter, and eventually they buy the info products.

The blog is available in 8 different countries.

Based on the data from three months, I try to find useful information and insights for Dilan to invest his time and money wisely for run the business more efficiently.
